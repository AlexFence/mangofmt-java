# Mangofmt-Java
This is my attempt on writing Java bindings for my Rust Library [mangofmt](https://github.com/AlexFence/mango), using the jni.

I am currently still confused about how all the stuff works, but I guess I'll be puzzling everything together with a 20 year old book, so that's gonna be fun. I think I can make this work (´・ω・\`)

I don't think this library will ever be used for anything, I am mainly doing this because I can! 

I also don't think that I am going to finish this anytime soon, finishing/cleaning up the main library is more important for the moment.
